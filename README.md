## Download
You can download this app as an ``.apk`` in the [Releases](https://github.com/tohrxyz/zephyrus-wallet/tags).

Or build from source, I recommed doing this via ``Android Studio``.

## How to get testnet coins?
To obtain some coins for testing, you can use any bitcoin testnet faucet. It's a website, that will send you a small amount of balance for testing purpouses, search for it :)
